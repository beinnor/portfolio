## My new 2020 personal portfolio

This is my new portofolio for 2020. I use this site for fun and learning. Made with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. It uses a custom Gatsby plugin that pulls data and screenshots from my pinned repositories on Github, and showcases them on my site. Very proud 😁

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://beinnor.netlify.com)

```

## Usage

```sh
gatsby develop
```

or

```sh
gatsby build

Although I haven't written any tests yet... 😳
